# Runbooks

Operational and upgrade procedures for blockchain infrastructure management, focusing on Polygon ecosystem protocols and smart contract operations.

## Structure

```
├── operations/          # Contract interactions and operational procedures
└── upgrades/           # Smart contract upgrade procedures
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Appropriate system permissions and network access
- Web3 wallet (MetaMask, etc.)
- Gnosis Safe multisig access (where applicable)
- Required tools as specified in individual procedures

### Usage
1. Navigate to the relevant directory (`operations/` or `upgrades/`)
2. Read the specific runbook's prerequisites
3. Follow the step-by-step instructions
4. Verify results as documented

## Multi-Signature Operations

Many procedures require multisig operations:
- **Proposers**: Can propose transactions (e.g., Polygon IPs)
- **Signers**: Can review, approve, and execute transactions
- **Execution**: Requires meeting the signature threshold

## Security

⚠️ **Important**: 
- Always verify contract addresses and parameters before execution
- Test procedures in testnet environments when possible
- Ensure proper authorization before executing operations
- Keep detailed records for audit purposes
- Blockchain operations are irreversible - proceed with caution

## Contributing

When adding new runbooks:
- Use the established documentation format
- Include prerequisites, step-by-step instructions, and verification steps
- Add security considerations and troubleshooting guidance
- Test procedures before committing
